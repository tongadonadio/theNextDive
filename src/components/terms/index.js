          <h2>1. We do not sell Diving Products</h2>
          <p>
            Our Website is a diving search engine. TheNextDive does not provide,
            own or control any of the diving services and products that you can
            access through Our Website, such as diving trips, classes or gear
            rentals (the “Diving Products”). The Diving Products are owned,
            controlled or made available by third parties (the “Diving
            Providers”) either directly (e.g. diving center) or as an agent
            (e.g. travel agency). The Diving Providers are responsible for the
            Diving Products. The Diving Provider’s terms and privacy policies
            apply to your booking so you must agree to, and understand those
            terms. Further, the terms of the actual diving provider apply to
            your diving, so you must also agree to and understand those terms.
            Your interaction with any Diving Provider accessed through Our
            Website is at your own risk and TheNextDive does not have any
            responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during
            your diving.
          </p>
          <p>
            The display on Our Website of a Diving Product or Diving Provider
            does not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute a recommendation
            by TheNextDive of that Diving Product or Diving Provider, or any
            sponsorship or approval of TheNextDive by such Diving Provider, or
            any affiliation between such Diving Provider and TheNextDive.
          </p>
          <p>
            TheNextDive hosts content, including prices, made available by or
            obtained from Diving Providers. TheNextDive is in no way responsible
            for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content. Since
            TheNextDive has no control over the Diving Products and does not
            verify the content uploaded by the Diving Providers, it is not
            possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on Our Website.
            Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g. payment fees,
            services charges, local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should
            always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you
            expected. Some Diving Products may also be sold in another currency
            than the one preset or chosen by you for the display of the search
            results. Our currency conversion is for information purposes only
            and should not be relied upon as accurate and real time; actual
            rates may vary and your payment provider (e.g. your credit card
            company) may charge conversion fees and apply another date’s
            currency rate.
          </p>
          <h2>2. Booking through TheNextDive</h2>
          <p>
            If you make a booking through Our Website for Diving Products, that
            booking is made with the Diving Provider named on the booking page
            and Our Website only acts as a user interface. Accordingly
            TheNextDive has no responsibility for the booking or the Diving
            Product because TheNextDive has no involvement in creating the
            description of the Diving Product, in defining the price and any
            fees, and in providing the Diving Products that you book. If you
            have any issues or disputes around your booking and/or the Diving
            Product, you agree to address and resolve these with the Diving
            Provider and not with us.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Warranty disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            Our Website, all content and services provided on Our Website and
            all itineraries you obtain through Trips are provided on an "as is"
            and "as available" basis. Our content is largely generated in an
            automated fashion; errors can and do happen. We usually have many
            search results, but we are not comprehensive and do not display all
            available providers and offers. Accordingly, we do not always
            display the lowest available price. TheNextDive expressly disclaims
            to the fullest extent permissible all warranties of any kind,
            whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, any
            implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose, title, non-infringement, and security and accuracy, as well
            as all warranties arising by usage of trade, course of dealing, or
            course of performance
          </p>
          <h2>7. Our liability is limited</h2>
          <p>
            We (together with our officers, directors, employees,
            representatives, shareholders, affiliates, and providers) to the
            extent permitted by law hereby expressly exclude any responsibility
            and liability for (a) any loss or damages to, or viruses that may
            infect, your computer equipment or other property as the result of
            your access to Our Website, your downloading of any content from Our
            Website or your use of Trips or (b) any injury, death, loss, claim,
            act of god, accident, delay, or any direct, special, exemplary,
            punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential damages of any kind
            (including without limitation lost profits or lost savings), whether
            based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, that arise
            out of or is in any way connected with: (i) any use of Our Website,
            Trips or our content; (ii) any failure or delay (including without
            limitation the use of or inability to use any component of this
            Website for reservations or booking); or (iii) the performance or
            non performance by us or any Diving Provider, even if we have been
            advised of the possibility of damages to such parties or any other
            party. Some states or countries do not allow this limitation of
            liability, so the limitations above may not apply or apply only
            partially to you.
          </p>
          <h2>8. You Agree to Protect Us</h2>
          <p>
            Subject to these Terms, you will defend, indemnify and hold us and
            each of our officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from
            and against any claim, cause of action, liability, expense, loss or
            demand, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting
            fees, arising out of, or in any way connected with your breach of
            these Terms or the agreements made part of these Terms by reference,
            your breach of any applicable law, and your use of or access to Our
            Website, Trips or the Intellectual Property.
          </p>
          <h2>9. Arbitration and Waiver</h2>
          <p>
            You agree that by accepting the Terms, you and Company are each
            waiving the right to trial by jury and the ability to participate in
            a class action. ANY AND ALL DISPUTES COMPANY OR YOU HAS RELATING IN
            ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY
            (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WITH RESPECT TO DATA, YOUR INTERACTION
            WITH THE COMPANY, COMPANY’S ADVERTISEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, EMAIL
            AND MOBILE SMS (TEXT) MESSAGES COMPANY SENDS TO YOU, OR THE USE OR
            DISCLOSURE OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU), THESE TERMS OF USE, AND
            PRIVACY POLCY (COLLECTIVELY, “CLAIMS”) WILL BE SUBMITTED TO
            CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL DISTRICT IN WHICH
            YOU RESIDE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE, IN ANY WAY, VIOLATED
            OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE ANY COMPANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT.
            CLAIMS INCLUDE CLAIMS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING INTENTIONAL
            TORT), FRAUD, AGENCY, YOUR OR THE COMPANY’S NEGLIGENCE, STATUTORY OR
            REGULATORY PROVISIONS, OR ANY OTHER SOURCE OF LAW.
          </p>
          <p>
            If You intend to seek arbitration You must first send to the
            Company, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
            The Notice to Company must be sent to legal@thenextdive.com. The
            Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes
            and the specific relief sought. If you and we cannot reach an
            agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the
            Notice is received, you or we may commence arbitration. All
            arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the
            Commercial Arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
            Association. The arbitrator’s award is binding and may be entered in
            any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted
            by applicable law, no arbitration brought under, or with respect to,
            Claims is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party
            subject to these Terms whether through class arbitration proceedings
            or otherwise. Unless Company and You agree otherwise, the arbitrator
            may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not
            otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private
            attorney general or class proceeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            For arbitration claims you assert against Company in accordance with
            this section (but not for any arbitration claim against you) Company
            will pay all of your administrative, hearing, and arbitrator’s fees
            and costs for the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs
            of your lawyers, experts, or witnesses) in excess of any filing fee
            you would have been required to pay to file the claim as a lawsuit
            in a state or federal court (whichever is greater) in the judicial
            district in which you reside. Unless unlawful, Company will pay its,
            and you will pay your, lawyers’, experts’, and witness fees,
            expenses, and costs with respect to all claims. The arbitrator may
            award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual
            party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
            relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Similarly, an
            arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that
            specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce
            the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration,
            the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or
            her award unless requested to do so by all parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WILL NOT AGREE TO ACT AS A
            REPRESENTATIVE OR A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER
            REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF
            CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST COMPANY IN ANY COURT, OR IN
            ARBITRATION, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS. THIS SECTION (CONFIDENTIAL
            ARBITRATION) WILL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP
            BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY. ANY AND ALL DISPUTES COMPANY OR YOU HAS
            RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
            COMPANY
